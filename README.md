# Ruby-on-Rails

I learned the fundamentals of Go, including loops, conditionals, and functions. I explored concurrency with Goroutines and channels (like a real-time chat). I mastered testing, built dynamic web servers, and created RESTful APIs with MySQL. I implemented ORM using GORM for CRUD systems. I had hands-on experience at every step!
